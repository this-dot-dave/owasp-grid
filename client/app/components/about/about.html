			All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are
	free and open to anyone interested in improving application
	security. We advocate approaching application security as a
	people, process, and technology problem, because the most
	effective approaches to application security require
	improvements in all of these areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from
	commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical,
	cost-effective information about application security. OWASP
	is not affiliated with any technology company, although we
	support the informed use of commercial security technology.
	Similar to many open source software projects, OWASP
	produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way.
		</p>
		<p>
			The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures
	the project’s long-term success. Almost everyone associated
	with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP Board,
	Chapter Leaders, Project Leaders, and project members. We
	support innovative security research with grants and
	infrastructure.
