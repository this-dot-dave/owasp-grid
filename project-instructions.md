# Simple Grid Style Angular Component Project

* Design a web page that has a simple grid style Angular component that lists elements of a security vulnerability.
 
* It would be great to have client side sorting applied to each of the columns.
 
* There does not need to be a back-end API call, he can seed the grid with “hard-coded” data.
 
* He can Submit through a github URL.
